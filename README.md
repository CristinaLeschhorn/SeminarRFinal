# USE THE FIA_RAW_DATA_WITH_ENV_CLEANED 
1. Conduct EDA
2. Calculate species richness (sr) at LAT BAND 
3. Calculate the average sr aggregated at the latitudinal band
4. Calculate the moving average at 0.5 degree interval
5. Estimate the SR using bootstrapping methods (1000 times simulation) and report mean and std. sr. Select 200 and run 1000 times 
6. Present work using ggplot
