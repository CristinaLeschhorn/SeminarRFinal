Use FIA full dataset (eastern US forest)

Conduct EDA
Calculate species richness (sr) at grid level
Calculate average sr aggregated at the latitudinal band
Calculate the moving average at 0.5 degree interval
Estimate the SR using bootstrapping methods (1000 times simulation) and report mean and std. sr
Present your work using ggplot
